                    <h3>Our Story</h3>
                    <p>
                        Around the House is more than just a business; it's a continuation of a family legacy and a dream shared by two cousins, John Borg and Damien Granger. What started as a remodeling company founded by John’s father has evolved into a versatile home maintenance service. After the passing of John’s father, we decided to honor his memory by transitioning the business from remodeling to pressure washing and home care services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally named "Pressure Bros," our business quickly grew, and after discovering an old flyer from the original company, we rebranded to "Around the House" to reflect the wide range of services we offer today.

                    <h3>Our Team</h3>
                    <p>
                        As a small, family-operated business, John and Damien handle every aspect of the company themselves:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>John Borg:</strong> Website development, branding, and customer relations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Damien Granger:</strong> Social media management and marketing.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        We share the physical labor equally, ensuring that every job is completed with the highest standards of quality and care.

                    <p>For homes in Baton Rouge, we recommend pressure washing at least once a year due to the region’s humidity, which can lead to mold and mildew buildup. If you have lots of trees or live near water, you might consider more frequent cleanings.</p>
