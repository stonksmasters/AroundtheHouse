                    <p>
                        <strong>Around the House</strong> is more than just a business; it's a continuation of a family legacy. Founded by cousins <strong>John Borg</strong> and <strong>Damien Granger</strong>, the company started as a remodeling business under John’s father. After his passing, we rebranded and expanded to offer comprehensive services, including junk removal and moving services, honoring his memory by transforming homes across Louisiana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally known as <em>"Pressure Bros,"</em> we discovered an old flyer from the original company and rebranded to <strong>"Around the House"</strong> to reflect our broader range of services. We’re proud to serve our local community with dedication, care, and a commitment to excellence.

                    <div class="faq-answer" aria-labelledby="faq5">
                        <p>For homes in Plaquemine, we recommend pressure washing at least once a year due to the region’s humidity, which can lead to mold and mildew buildup. If you have lots of trees or live near water, you might consider more frequent cleanings.</p>
