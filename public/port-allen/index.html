                    <p>
                        <strong>Around the House</strong> is more than just a business; it's a continuation of a family legacy. Founded by cousins <strong>John Borg</strong> and <strong>Damien Granger</strong>, the company started as a remodeling business under John’s father. After his passing, we rebranded and expanded to offer comprehensive pressure washing and home care services, honoring his memory by transforming homes across Louisiana.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Originally known as <em>"Pressure Bros,"</em> we discovered an old flyer from the original company and rebranded to <strong>"Around the House"</strong> to reflect our broader range of services. We’re proud to serve our local community with dedication, care, and a commitment to excellence.

                        <p>We use professional-grade John Deere 4000 psi and 4GPM pressure washers, along with environmentally safe cleaning solutions. Our equipment is powerful enough to handle tough grime but gentle enough to protect surfaces, especially older homes and delicate materials.</p>

                        <p>For homes in Port Allen, we recommend pressure washing at least once a year due to the region’s humidity, which can lead to mold and mildew buildup. If you have lots of trees or live near water, you might consider more frequent cleanings.</p>
