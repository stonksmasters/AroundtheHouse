Susan I.,House Cleaning,"Around the House cleaners were quick to respond, communicative, dependable and punctual. The two cleaners tackled a difficult job and did excellent work and they were a joy to work with. They were efficient and thorough, and went above and beyond expectations. We definitely plan to hire them on an ongoing basis.",2023-07-27,Verified,5,

Melissa C.,Pressure Washing,"John & Damien did an excellent job on my house, walkways & driveway. I have an older home & they did a great job getting my house clean & protecting my older wood & paint. All the concrete looks brand new. Wish I had before pictures (only after). I plan to have them come every 6 months for a clean. Great job! Highly recommend!",2023-02-28,Verified,5,,
Damien G.,Store Cleaning,"Damien and John offered to do my local store for free. All I had to do was leave a review, they worked in the rain and made sure not to leave until the job was done. Our sidewalk had grease stains and oil and they made sure to get every bit!",2023-01-31,Verified,,5,
